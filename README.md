# Disease Predictor

Disease Predictor is a Flask-based web application that uses machine learning algorithms to predict various diseases. Currently, the application can predict the following:
- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Parkinson's Disease

This project aims to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for entering medical data and receiving predictions quickly and accurately.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface.
- Integrated machine learning models for accurate disease predictions.
- Supports predictions for multiple diseases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-predictor.git
cd disease-predictor
```

### Create a Virtual Environment
To ensure that the application runs seamlessly, it is recommended to set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
